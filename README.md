# Reversi-game
An intelligent game agent with minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms

### Objective
* In this project, you will write a program to determine the minimax value for given positions of the Reversi game, using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm with positional weight evaluation functions.

### Rules of the Game
* The rules of the Reversi game can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi and interactive examples can be found at http://www.samsoft.org.uk/reversi/.
